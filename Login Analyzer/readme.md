# Login Analyzer Project

## Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate a small-scale security monitoring system that detects suspicious login activity. Using a SQLite database of user logins, and Python fon for filtering and output creation, the script identifies failed login attempts occurring outside of standard working hours and generates a report for analysis. This helps understand the basics of intrusion detection and automated monitoring.


### Skills Learned

- **Python scripting**: Reading and processing data from databases, working with `datetime` objects, conditional filtering, and file I/O.
    
- **SQL & SQLite**: Creating tables, inserting sample data, querying for specific conditions, and exporting data.
    
- **Data analysis & automation**: Automating the detection of anomalies based on rules (failed login + outside working hours).
    
- **Reporting**: Writing structured output to text and SQL files for further review or auditing.
    
- **Basic cybersecurity awareness**: Understanding how login patterns can indicate suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
### Tools Used

- Python
- SQL
- Bash

## Steps
### 1. Creating a sample data of 5 people with attempted login (fictional).

- Creating  a file for generating database using python with SQLite import

- Created a fictional 5 subjects with varying names, devices, IPs, geolocation, status, and timestamps, with the intentional one suspicious subject that attempted a login and failed outside working hours.

- Made it executable to generate the database file.
---

### 2. Run it to generate data file.

- Located and ran the .py file.

- Check if successful.

### 3. Creating the python file analyzer that would find suspicious activity of the subjects within the database.

- Created and imported SQL and defined the file outputs

- Defined my parameters and added ==`for`== loops for filtering and conditional statement prints

![](../../../Image%20dump/Login%20Analyzer/screenshot_17112025_132826.jpg)

- Created an ==`echo`== for an output print, and defining conditional findings of suspicious activity or no suspicious findings then a separate new SQL file for reference.

- Execute the ==analyzer.py==, then confirmed the 2 file outputs.
---

### 4. Look at the contents of the file outputs.

- Confirmed and filtered, that =="Bob Santos"== was the suspicious that attempted login outside working hours showing his devices, IP, and location.
