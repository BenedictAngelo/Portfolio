## Computer Network Basics
**Computer Network** - is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources

**Client** - is a device that access a service made available by a server. ==A client can be a server.==

**Server** - a device that provides or services for clients. ==A server can be a client.==

**End host** - Are the device that is the last receiving end of the data in a network

**Local Area Network (LAN)** - Is a network composed of local connected device to the switch

**Switches** - Is a device used to connect multiple end point devices on a local area
- Has many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to. ==usually 24+==
- Provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
- Does not provide connectivity between other LAN or over the internet

**Routers** - a device that switches attaches to, to connect to the internet

- ==ISR 1000== and ==ISR 4000== has their network interfaces at the back while ==ISR 900== has it on front
- Routers have ==lesser network interfaces than switches==.
- Are used to provide connectivity between LANs and internet

---
**Firewalls** - Is a device or an application that can be placed after or before the router to protect and filter the LAN on malicious data over the internet
- Monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules
- Can be place inside the network or outside
- ==Next generation firewalls== are those with modern and advanced filtering capabilities

**Network Firewalls** - are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks

- ==ASA5500-X or Adaptive Security Appliance== is Cisco's classic firewall, a ==next generation firewall==
- Next generation firewalls are called ==IPS or Intrusion Prevention System==
- Firepower 2100 is a ==next generation firewall==

**Host-Based Firewalls** - are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC
