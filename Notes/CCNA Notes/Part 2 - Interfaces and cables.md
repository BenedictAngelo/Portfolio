- Ports like those are called RJ-45 ports (Registered jack)

- Used in copper connected cables

## Ethernet

- Is a collection of network protocol/standards
- Industry standard

### Bits and Bytes

- 0 and 1, off or on, this are called **Bits**
- 01100111 , this is an example of Byte, 8 characters
- Speed is measured in **Bits per second** (kpbs, Mbps, Gbps, etc)
- Data on a hard drive is Bytes per second, which larger
- 1 kilobit = 1000 bits
- 1 megabit = 1,000,000 bits
- 1 gigabit = 1,000,000,000 bits
- 1 terabit = 1,000,000,000,000 bits


### Ethernet standards

- Defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard in 1983
- IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers

### Ethernet standards (Copper)

- "BASE" refers to baseband signaling, "T" is for twisted pair

### UTP cables

- Unshielded means the wires have no metallic shield, make them vulnerable from electromagnetic interference
- Twisted pair protects against EMI
