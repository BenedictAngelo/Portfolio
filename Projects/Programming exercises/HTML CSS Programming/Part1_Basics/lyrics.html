    [Verse 1]
    Lost in the fog
    I fear that there's still further to fall
    It's dangerous 'cause I want it all
    And I don't think I care what it costs

    [Pre-Chorus]
    I shouldn't have fallen in love
    Look what it made me become
    I let you get too close
    Just to wake up alone
    And I know you think you can run
    You're scared to believe I'm the one
    But I just can't let you go

    [Chorus]
    I'd let the world burn
    Let the world burn for you
    This is how it always had to end
    If I can't have you, then no one can
    I'd let it burn
    I'd let the world burn
    Just to hear you calling out my name
    Watchin' it all go down in flames

    [Verse 2]
    Fеar in their eyes
    Ash rainin' from thе blood orange sky
    I let everybody know that you're mine

    [Pre-Chorus]
    Before we're swept into the dust
    Look what you made me become
    I let you get too close
    Just to wake up alone
    And I know you think you can run
    You're scared to believe I'm the one
    But I just can't let you go

    [Chorus]
    I'd let the world burn
    Let the world burn for you
    This is how it always had to end
    If I can't have you, then no one can
    I'd let it burn
    I'd let the world burn
    Just to hear you calling out my name
    Watchin' it all go down in flames

    [Bridge]
    Let it all burn
    Oh, I'd burn this world for you
    Oh, baby I'd let it burn
    For you

    [Outro]
    I'd let the world burn
    Let the world burn for you
    This is how it always had to end
    If I can't have you, then no one can
